# Inboxly

A recreation of [Inbox by Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbox_by_Gmail) as a native desktop email client, built in Rust with [Iced](https://iced.rs/).

## Why

Google killed Inbox in April 2019. Nothing has replaced its unique approach to email: bundles, highlights, snooze, sweep, and smart extraction. Inboxly aims to bring it back as a fully local, privacy-respecting desktop application.

## Architecture

8-crate Cargo workspace:

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `inboxly-core` | Core types, traits, and error definitions |
| `inboxly-imap` | IMAP sync engine and OAuth2 authentication |
| `inboxly-store` | Maildir, SQLite, and Tantivy storage layer |
| `inboxly-bundler` | Email categorisation engine |
| `inboxly-snooze` | Snooze scheduler and reminder system |
| `inboxly-extract` | Smart extraction and highlight detection |
| `inboxly-ui` | Iced-based desktop UI |
| `inboxly` | Binary entry point |
